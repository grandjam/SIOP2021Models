> Grand, J.A. (April, 2021). *Hello World! Tools, techniques, and getting started with computational modeling.* Symposium presentation at the 36th annual meeting of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, New Orleans, LA.

Please note that although I wrote all the code and documentation for both the models available in this repository, full intellectural credit for and any substantive citations associated with either model should be given to the original authors. Any mistakes, errors, or deviations in the code for either model downloaded from this repository are mine and should not be attributed to the original authors.

## Required software
Both models are coded using the R programming language. To open and execute the provided code, you should have a version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) installed on your computer.

## Organization
The two example models are organized into separate folders that can be accessed by clicking their respective folders from the list above. Alternatively, you may download both models in a single ZIP file from the Releases page. The publication citations, pseudocode, and basic instructions for running both models are provided in the ReadMe files within each folder.
